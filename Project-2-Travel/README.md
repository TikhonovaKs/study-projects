### Introduction
Educational project "Journey through Russia", adaptive layout.
Building layout according to the layout in Figma;
When building an adaptive layout, I started from the screen sizes: 320, 768, 1024 and 1280 pixels (according to the layout).
The site must display correctly in Firefox, Google Chrome or Yandex Browser;

### Figma

### Description:
In this project work, I used the following **technologies:**
* building grids: Flexbox layout and Grid Layout;
* positioning and advanced semantics of the HTML language;
* naming classes according to the rules of BEM and building the file structure of the project according to the rules of Nested BEM;
* connecting styles in a separate file;
* using Perfect Pixel to meet requirements: "element widths and padding differ from layout by no more than 30px at breakpoints: 1280px, 1024px. And 10px at breakpoints: 768px, 320px";
* all links and clickable elements have a hover state of :hover.

To **build an adaptive** layout, I applied:
* relative sizes of blocks and text elements;
* optimization of fonts for devices with different resolutions;
* the calc() function for uniform site behavior between given breakpoints in the layout;
* Meta tags for correct page scaling;
* media queries.
