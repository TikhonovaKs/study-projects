            <h2 class="intro__title">What didn't we see there?</h2>
            <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country.
                Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans and the harsh
                ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many hours of flights.
                Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, put them in her Lada and drove
                20 thousand kilometers in his native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                    <p class=place__paragraph>Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge,
                        you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with
                        invisible miracle of these places - mountain air.</p>
                    <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. So you will see all the variety
                        local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And famous
                        manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, it's all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skiing competitions. It's that kind
                        sport, when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. March 2019
